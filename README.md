Instructions on how to use the template


1. Clone the template into your shell environment.

2. Create a C++ file in the root directory of the template (there is a default file called prog1.cpp)

3. Run: cmake .

4. Run: make

5. An executable with the same name as the cpp file will be generated in the same directory.

In case you have header files or libraries you wish to import into your project:

1. mkdir include

2. Put your header files in the include directory.

3. This makes your project more organized.



If you are thinking about using WSL Ubuntu for CS2040C, I have my WSL config that helps a lot in turning your CLI into a more IDE type 
environment. (wsl config)[https://github.com/yzia2000/dotfiles]
